My journey is one of continuous growth and expansion! I believe that in order to succeed and maximize potential that people should be striving to always learn and progress. This belief system is the same thing that has lead me to my journey as a sotfware engineer! I enjoy consistently challenging myself and finding / creating new and better ways to do things or even think / perceive things and this is why I have chosen software engineering for my path. It will simulataneously allow me to create, learn, and expand and ultimately will lead me to a better life all around, I'm sure. 

I have very little experience with coding but I believe that people can do anything that they set their mind to with a fine blend of focus patience and drive. I first dabbled in coding when I was a teenager dabbling in HTML with myspace (lol) and eventually creating my own private server for an online game I played back then called Maplestory. (lol again)
Those both were pretty fun experiences where I got to see how firsthand I could excercise my creativity using coding and that really excited me as that is something I am passionate about, as I am a musician as well! I also am a very theoretical person which I feel will benefit me in this journey. 

I rekindled my interest in coding in the past year as I started learning French, I decided to start learning coding as well. Shortly after I realized that a lot of it clicked for me as I fancy puzzles, challenging myself, and have had a little experience in my past with it, and then I started considering Software Engineering as a career! After that, I found Career Karma who helped me a lot in finding my way, and finally I found Flatiron school. Now my journey begins!

I hope to be able to use software engineering to not only create a better life for myself, but to also create new avenues that can not only serve people, but that also can serve the world as a whole.
