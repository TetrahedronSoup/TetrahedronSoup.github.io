<p>I am 25 years old, I produce and compose music, and am just beginning my journey into software engineering and web development in order to open more creative avenues in my life and to improve my life overall. I strive to always be learning and to see the bigger picture of things. Currently I am living in Spokane, WA and originally I am from Baton Rouge, LA. </p>
